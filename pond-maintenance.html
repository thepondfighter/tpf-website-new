			<p> 
				Ponds, like grass, require regular maintenance to keep up their appearance.
				The good news is that thanks to technological advancements, particularly in pumps and skimmers, ponds have become more self-sufficient than ever before.			
			</p>
			<h2> Basic Components of a backyard pond </h2>
			<h4>
				Pump
			</h4>
			<p>
				The pump is the heart of the pond: it circulates water through arteries of underground pvc, 
				supplies oxygen through magnificent cascades, and produces the soothing beat of running water.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Skimmer
			</h4>
			<p>
				Skimmers are designed to house the pump and are typically located along the edge of the pond. 
				Leaves and twigs that fall into the pond are skimmed and held in a basket
				for easy removal.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Liner
			</h4>
			<p>
				Liners keep water inside a pond and are malleable enough to be used to create long, curvy streams.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Waterfalls and Streams
			</h4>
			<p>
				Waterfalls and streams are built using drops of elevation. They are the source of the sound of flowing water that everyone enjoys.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Filtration
			</h4>
			<p>
				Filters today are integrated inside the waterfall where you can find various media such as lava rock, filter mats, and sponges. 
				As the pump forces water through these media, the water is rid of contaminants and returned back to the pond.
			</p>
			<h2>Seasonal Maintenance Tips</h2>
			<h3>Spring</h3>
			<p>
				As winter comes to an end and the weather gets warmer, 
				fish will become more active, plants will begin to sprout, and sunlight will increase. 
				During this time, organic matter that accumulated over the winter will start to thaw and release nutrients into the water.
				Because many pond plants do not sprout until May, these nutrients are frequently left unprocessed, creating an environment for algae when combined with increasing sunlight.
				Getting the pond cleaned during this time can prevent algae blooms from happening by ridding the pond of these unwanted nutrients.
			<ul>
				<li> Remove the debris at the bottom of the pond </li>
				<li> Perform a water change </li>
				<li> Be cautious not to overfeed the fish as any remaining pellets will be fuel for algae </li>
				<li> Add beneficial bacteria </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Summer</h3>
			<p>
				During summer it is important to keep the pond cool. Algae grow faster in warmer water so surface blocking plants such as lilies and hyacinths should 
				be added to shade the pond.
				For ponds with a large quantity of fish, aerators can be added to increase oxygen levels and circulation. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Top off the pond with the garden hose every few days </li>
				<li> Create shade by adding surface blocking plants such as water liles and hyacinths  </li>
				<li> Add aeretors to increase oxygen and circulation </li>
				<li> Add more plants if there is too much algae </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Fall</h3>
			<p>
				Because leaves will begin to fall from trees during this time, nets should be installed for ponds that are located under a lot of trees. Dying plant stems should also be trimmed back
				before they settle at the bottom of the pond.			
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Cover the pond with a net </li>
				<li> Remove the leaves inside the skimmer basket </li>
				<li> Top off the pond with the garden hose </li>
				<li> Skim debris out the pond </li>
				<li> trim back plants </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Winter</h3>
			<p>
				When the water gets below 50 degrees fahrenheit stop feeding the fish. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Remove the debris at the bottom of the pond </li>
				<li> Gradually start to feed the fish </li>
				<li> Top off the pond with the garden hose.  </li>
			</ul>

							<div class="accordion-body">
								If your pond was recently built, it is normal to have cloudy water
								for the first few weeks due to residue from the rocks.
								During this time, it is critical to keep bioload (fish and fish food) to a minimum as you wait for the nitrogen cycle to finish. 
								You have probably heard of people 'waiting for the tank to cycle' when setting up new aquariums. They are referring to the same nitrogen cycle.
								During this time, beneficial bacteria convert harmful compounds such as ammonia (found in fish waste) into nitrates (harmless in small amounts). These nitrates
								are then used by your pond plants for growth and development. Keeping your bioload low while your pond is still in the cycling phase will give it
								the time needed to grow bacteria that keep your water clear. 
								<li>
									Wait for your pond to finish cycling before adding a large amount of fish
								</li>
								<li>
									Dont feed the fish too much
								</li>
								<li>
									use filter media that already have healthy bacteria colonies
								</li>
								<li>
									add plants to assist with filtration

							<div class="accordion-body">
								If you've had your pond for a while and are having problems with water clarity, the most likely culprit is your filtration. 
								Filtration in your pond can take many forms, including filter media (mats, lava rock, bioballs, sponges) or more natural elements such as plants, bacteria, and so on.
								If you are experiencing a sudden burst of cloudy water, it is possible that you recently added more fish than your pond can handle, 
								or your fish have outgrown the filtration that was once adequate for your pond. 
								A water change is the simplest solution to this problem; however, if the water becomes cloudy again in a short period of time, you must increase the 
								filtration inside your pond.

							<div class="accordion-body">
								The majority of algae in ponds is completely harmless and becomes a problem only when it becomes too excessive.
								Just like plants, algae need nutrients and sunlight to grow so by reducing one of these elements, algae will also reduce. 
								You can do this by introducing surface blocking plants such as hyacinths and waterlilies. 
								These plants not only provide shade, but also filter water (reducing nutrients) and create hiding spots for your fish. 
								Plants are essential to keep algae levels low in your pond.
