            <p> 
				Although properly installed ponds rarely have issues, most ponds are built DIY and as a result, develop problems over time.
				Improper construction techniques used when building these ponds often lead to structural, functional, and aesthetic issues. 
				It is critical to address these problems before they escalate into larger, more costly repairs.


			</p>

			<h2 class="blog-post-title">Leaks</h2>



            <p>
				 The average rate of
                water loss for most ponds is about half an inch to two inches of water per day. Ponds will naturally lose water due to the weather, splashing of the water, and evaporation. 
				Other factors that affect this amount include
				the flow rate of the pump and the surface area of the pond. If a pond is losing more water than normal, a leak may have developed somewhere along the pond.
				The three most common areas of leaks are the stream, plumbing, and liner. 

			</p>

			<h2 class="blog-post-title">Common leak locations</h2>

			
			<h4 class="blog-post-title">Stream</h4>

			<p>
				
				Streams are a common source of leaks because they are often built with less structural support than the rest of the pond. 
				Unlike pond walls, which are typicallly supported by large quantities of rocks and boulders, stream walls are frequently left bare.
				Without the support of the rocks, these walls are susceptibe to erosion and since they are normally very short, often only a few inches high, 
				it only takes a slight shift in the ground for the liner supporting the stream to sag and allow water to escape. 
		
			</p>

			<p>

				Visually inspecting for wet spots along the stream can help determine if a leak exists. Low points along the stream are common areas to check.				
		
			</p>
		
        

            <h4 class="blog-post-title">Liner</h2>
            <p>

                Holes in pond liners are most common in non-epdm liners such as those made of pvc and plastic. These materials are less durable, especially when exposed to prolonged sunlight. 
				This type of leak
				is easy to distinguish as water loss will occur even when the pump is not running.                
            </p>

			<p>

				The water level when the leak stops is going to be the same level as that of the leak. If the hole is at the bottom of the liner, the pond will completely empty out. If the hole is located 6 inches
				from the top of the pond, the pond will only lose water up until it reaches 6 inches from the top.
                       
            </p>


			<h4 class="blog-post-title">Plumbing</h4>

            <p>
				Commonly buried underground, the pipes and fittings used to deliver water to various locations around a pond can leak if improperly installed.            
            </p>

			<p>

				A simple way to diagnose a leak in the plumbing is to run the pump with a new piece of pvc or tubing. If the leak stops, there is water loss occuring somewhere in the old plumbing.


			</p>


			<h2 class="blog-post-title">Structural Issues</h2>

			<p> 

				Structural issues arise when the the ground supporting the pond begin to weaken. Anything from 
				damaged mortar to improper build technique can jeopardize the structural integrity of the pond.
				The stone walls inside a pond, arent just for decorative purposes: they serve as support for the ground behind them. 		

			</p>


			<h2 class="blog-post-title">Aesthetic Issues</h2>

            <h4 class="blog-post-title">Rocks</h2>

			<p> 
				Unappealing rock work is common in DIY ponds because its builders frequently choose to use smaller stones, which, while easier to work with, are unstable and unappealing.
			 Repairing the edge of the pond with larger stones and boulders can greatly enhance both its look and stability.


			</p>

			<!-- <h4 class="blog-post-title">Design</h2>

			<p>
				Common pond design issues include improper depth, unlevel surfaces, lack of vital components such as skimmers and shelves, unappealing shape, and many others.
				The design of a pond has a significant impact on its ability to function as a self-sustaining ecosystem. For example, the lack of shelves inside a pond may deter its owner from adding plants. 
				Plants help to balance the nutrients in a pond, and without them, a pond becomes more susceptible to water clarity issues and algae blooms.

				
				These ledges cause rocks to lean toward the pond and eventually fall in, exposing the liner underneath. 
				The only way to fix this is to relevel the edge of the pond to properly support
				the rocks.


			</p>

			<p>

				Most diy or landscaper-built ponds lack vital features such as shelves and skimmers.
				While these ponds may appear attractive from the outside, the lack of these components significantly increases maintenance
